## My process

My process was fairly simple. I wrote the html and css side-by-side because I did not have an idea of what all html elements I would need at the beginning. I initially thought of making the entire website as a grid but ended up dropping the idea because it was getting too complicated. I could have used media queries but I thought making the entire website fully responsive at all widths and not just on two would be a good challenge and a good way to test out my grid and flexbox skills.

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- HTML

### Problems

There are few problems I am facing with my design:
 - In the nav bar in the header, the transition property does not apply to text decoration.
 - The buttons seem to be transiting weirdly when the cursor is hovered.
 - The img [](.images/bg-curvy-desktop.svg) is behind the h1 tag in the design, but whenever I tried to do this, the image automatically made the h1 and the subtitle disappear.
 - I was also not able to make the testimonials grid exactly the way it is in the design, apparantly because of my incomplete knowledge of flexbox.
 - I cannot figure out how display the 'invalid email' message.
 - The site cannot be viewed properly on a mobile device.
It would be highly appreciated if someone could help me with these.

### Continued development

There are two main things I need to increase my understanding of:
 1. Flexbox
 2. Position
